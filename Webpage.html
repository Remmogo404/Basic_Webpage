<h1 id="myHeader"> Which City ! </h1>

<body>

<h2>
Robben Island
</h2>

<strong>
<p>
Robben Island is the city i choose, because the place as a whole holds such a rich political history of South Africa and most of South African icons were held there in the apartheid regim. And try out the experince of freedom swim from Robben Island to the Cape Town Shore.

<h1 id="myHeader"> Foreign Language ! </h1>
<h2>
Swahili
</h2>

</p>
I would love to learn Swahili, because it is predominantly a mix of local Bantu languages and Arabic. Decades of intensive trade along the East African coast resulted in this mix of cultures. Besides Arabic and Bantu, Swahili also has English, Persian, Portuguese, German and French influences due to trade contact. People whose mother tongue is Swahili, about five to 15 million worldwide, are often referred to as Waswahili.
